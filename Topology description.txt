I created simple lab. I created topology in GNS3 with VirtualBox, my Linux Server (where install ansible)  locate in one management broadcast domain with routers through single switch (I use network 192.192.192.0/21 - mng). Another switch connected between routers for routing and data.

Point-to-Point I created through sub-interfaces, like R1 <-> R2 use id 12 and network 192.168.12.0/24, between R2 <-> R3 id 23 network 192.168.23.0/24 and so on. Between routers routing protocols OSPF and BGP.

P.S. As tasks will add routers. Remote access from the server to routers through ssh.
